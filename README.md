The “search” portion of asearch-and-rescue missionis a slow and methodical process, the time it would take to sweep a small office would be about two hours. This is as a result of the search crew going in completely blind, forcing themto slow down in order to avoid anymishaps. There in lies the problem and the goal our project, we wish to speed up the search phase of a search-and-rescue mission with our operator controlled robotic vehicle, the Wisp. Designed from the ground upwiththe input from BCIT’s Light Urban Search-and-rescue Team (LUSAR), the Wisp endeavorsto integrateitself seamlessly into their workflow,providing concrete data from a multitude of environmental sensorsand the ability of to see upcoming hazards from its camera systems. The following report will provide more details about the Wispand its core features as well as some background information regarding the team such as the people behind the project, the task allocation and thetimeline.
